## What projects am I working now? 🗂️

I am currently working on a few projects that will help me deepen my knowledge and experience in programming. These projects are important to me because they cover every type of website category and function that is currently used widely and commercially. **Here are a few of them:**

- **Currency converter** 💹
	> A website where you can convert currency from around the world at the current rate.

- **General homepage** 👨🏻‍💼
	> A website dedicated to me that serves as an electronic CV.
	
- **To do list** 📋
	> A website where you can easily create your own shopping list or daily plan.
	
- **Travel blog** 🗺️
	>An article type website where I describe my trips.

## What am I learning right now? 📘

At this point I am deepening my knowledge in the field of **Backend**, as I have learned **Frontend** before.

## Where and how would I like to work in the near future? 💻

Since I am an ambitious person and I like challenges, in the near future I would like to work in a foreign team on a large project in which I could increase my knowledge in practice and feel the power of creating something big that I can be very proud of.r.
