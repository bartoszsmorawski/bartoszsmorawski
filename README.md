	> A website dedicated to me that serves as an electronic CV.
	
- **To do list** 📋
	> A website where you can easily create your own shopping list or daily plan.
	
- **Travel blog** 🗺️
	>An article type website where I describe my trips.

## What am I learning right now? 📘

At this point I am deepening my knowledge in the field of **Backend**, as I have learned **Frontend** before.

## Where and how would I like to work in the near future? 💻
